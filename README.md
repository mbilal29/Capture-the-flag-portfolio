# Capture the Flag (CTF) Portfolio  
**CSCD27 – Computer & Network Security**  
University of Toronto

## Overview

This repository documents my Capture the Flag (CTF) work completed as part of **CSCD27: Computer & Network Security** at the University of Toronto.  
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my hands-on experience with applied cybersecurity concepts, tools, and attack/defense techniques in a controlled academic environment.

Rather than focusing on flags or exploit code, this portfolio emphasizes **security concepts, threat models, and technical understanding**, making it suitable for professional and interview review.
